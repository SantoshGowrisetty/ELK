#paths may have changed, read through and recheck in git 
#the conf files exists in MyConfigsLS

>>MyConfigsLS/conf.d/logstash_simple.conf

#change paths according to your setup

#when running logstash check if your logstash is in /etc/logstash or in /usr/local/logstash and 
choose the one you prefer and have configured.

#once logstash is installed ,it can be run as a service or from command line
refering to a specific config file which controls input-filter-output of 
logstash pipeline

#if created 'conf.d' in 'logstash path' proceed, if not, create the directory & copy the logstash_simple.conf file.

--if not copied and building on your own
create a 'logstash-simple.conf' file
vi /usr/local/logstash/conf.d/logstash-simple.conf

#add details to configure input and output
input {
        stdin {}
}
output {
        stdout {}
}


#Option1
#run logstash from command line refering to conf file
#once run, test it by providing input on console and check the output

#since logstash was installed from tar (if any doubts, check Logstash setup instruction file)

#to run logstash pointing to our created *.conf file

#Option 2
(notice here,all conf files in 'conf.d' will be applicable for logstash

$ logstash --path.settings /usr/local/logstash

#going forward we will create conf files that have input + filter (with or without plugins)+ output and run logstash pipeline 
refering to specific file

#Option 3
(not required ,as we will run logstash instances pointing to specific files)

#We can start logstash as a service
#remember if we do it this way, it will look into all conf files within 'conf.d' too
#so if multiple pipeline confs created ,we can do this

#Letâ€™s enable Logstash on boot 
#sudo systemctl enable logstash.service
#let's start logstash as a service
sudo systemctl start logstash.service
