##
Configure metricbeat.yml
The main configuration file for metricbeat is metricbeat.yml available 
under /etc/metricbeat or in your chosen location (if downloaded tar)
You configure Metricbeat to write to a specific output (elasticsearch cluster nodes)
 by setting options in the
 Outputs section of the metricbeat.yml config file

refer metricbeat.yml files provided in Node1,Node2,Node3
for 

output.elasticsearch
protocol
username
password
ssl.certificate_authorities

Configure kibana endpoint
setup.kibana:
  host: "http://192.168.251.47:5601"

This is the Kibana server where dashboards will be loaded. 
If Kibana server is using SSL then use https

set other properties:
monitoring.enabled: true
setup.template.settings:
  index.number_of_shards: 1
  index.codec: best_compression

Note**The Elasticsearch monitoring features use ingest pipelines, therefore 
the cluster that stores the monitoring data must have at 
least one ingest node. Disable the default collection of Elasticsearch 
monitoring metrics. 
Set xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.collection.enabled to false 
on the production cluster.

Enable module to monitor elasticsearch cluster(on all nodes)
metricbeat modules enable elasticsearch-xpack

check and confirm if all nodes have same.
--after enabling elasticsearch-xpack, it should have contents as below
(if not, 
reference <metricbeatpath>/metricbeat.reference.yml file for example.
the contents can be copied from provided sample elasticsearch-xpack.xml)

cat <metricbeatpath>/modules.d/elasticsearch-xpack.yml

- module: elasticsearch
  metricsets:
    - ccr
    - cluster_stats
    - enrich
    - index
    - index_recovery
    - index_summary
    - ml_job
    - node_stats
    - shard
  period: 10s
  hosts: ["http://a1:9200"]

on each node:
By default, the system module is enabled. The information it collects, 
however, is not shown on the Monitoring page in Kibana. 
--we can disable this for now
metricbeat modules disable system

--start metricbeat as a service OR using command as shown below
systemctl start metricbeat

to check status 
journalctl -u metricbeat.service
(if any issues check permission on /etc/metricbeat)

login into kibana and click on 'stack monitoring'

#command to be run from metricbeat path unless classpath was already set
./metricbeat -e -c metricbeat.yml -v
