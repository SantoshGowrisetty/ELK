--Local Setup
After untaring, look into following paths
ls /usr/local/elasticsearch/config
--no certs as of in the beginning
ls /usr/local/elasticsearch/data
--no data folder
ls /usr/local/elasticsearch/logs
--nothing in logs folder

cat /usr/local/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
--just contains standard elasticsearch.yml file as in previous versions

#----------------------- END SECURITY AUTO CONFIGURATION -------------------------
============
After cluster is up, you will see this..

Elasticsearch security features have been automatically configured!
Authentication is enabled and cluster connections are encrypted.

Password for the elastic user (reset with `bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic`):
  OoaP0udcU--9uUziXqu-

HTTP CA certificate SHA-256 fingerprint:
  726bee774cc1bf97abeb0384f1edfcab2e74cb53d6b6b58d7005bbdc77db7a26

Configure Kibana to use this cluster:
Run Kibana and click the configuration link in the terminal when Kibana starts.
Copy the following enrollment token and paste it into Kibana in your browser (valid for the next 30 minutes):
  eyJ2ZXIiOiI4LjUuMCIsImFkciI6WyIxMjcuMC4wLjE6OTIwMCIsIls6OjFdOjkyMDAiXSwiZmdyIjoiNzI2YmVlNzc0Y2MxYmY5N2FiZWIwMzg0ZjFlZGZjYWIyZTc0Y2I1M2Q2YjZiNThkNzAwNWJiZGM3N2RiN2EyNiIsImtleSI6InBjSlNfSVlCdUY2SHB4a05vNnNMOkFIYnp0UWJTUXJTWGZfNFliczN4TUEifQ==

Configure other nodes to join this cluster:
On this node:
	Create an enrollment token with `bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node`.
        Uncomment the transport.host setting at the end of config/elasticsearch.yml.
        Restart Elasticsearch.
On other nodes:
  Start Elasticsearch with `bin/elasticsearch --enrollment-token <token>`, using the enrollment token that you generated.


#if 'discovery.seed_hosts' was configured like in previous versions
[2023-01-20T00:12:20,271][WARN ][o.e.c.c.Coordinator      ] [master] 
This node is a fully-formed single-node cluster with cluster UUID [R1RvKTdFR2qiPK931WajTg], but it is configured 
as if to discover other nodes and form a multi-node cluster via the [discovery.seed_hosts=[localhost]] setting. 
Fully-formed clusters do not attempt to discover other nodes, and nodes with different cluster UUIDs cannot 
belong to the same cluster. The cluster UUID persists across restarts and can only be changed by deleting 
the contents of the node's data path(s). Remove the discovery configuration to suppress this message.

===========
For kibana , start kibana and follow instructions as mentioned above..
unless 'configure kibana' step is done
we will see this message
'[2023-01-20T01:56:13,658][WARN ][o.e.x.s.t.n.SecurityNetty4HttpServerTransport] [master] received plaintext 
http traffic on an https channel, closing connection Netty4HttpChannel{localAddress=/127.0.0.1:9200, 
remoteAddress=/127.0.0.1:46550}'

--check dev tools

============
From command line
--if password for user elastic not known or lost, recreate it using command mentioned above 
--may need to reset pswd saved in for kibana

#example
curl -u elastic:F-8rbJG2Vgwe0Gt+nrpj -XGET "https://127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/nodes?v" -k
Here -k to allow insecure connection i.e. without cert
curl --cacert /usr/local/elasticsearch/config/certs/http_ca.crt https://localhost:9200 -u elastic:I5B*8vJ76Wwe8BF0bnQ0
