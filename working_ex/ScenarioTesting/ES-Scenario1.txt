Currently we have totally 4 nodes
3 nodes are master eligible and also action as data nodes
1 node is not master eligible but just acting as data node.

Which means at any point of time we can have max 1 copy as primary & 3 copies(as replicas) (on avai 4 data nodes)
Our index was created with default 5 primary shards, 1 replica shards
(which means data of index is divided into 5 shards and each shard has 1 replica)

#The distribution of primary and replica shards is as follows:
get /_cat/shards/population?pretty=true

#overall health for this index
get /_cluster/health/population?level=shards

#looking at more specific information
get /_cat/shards/population?h=index,shard,prirep,dc,state,node





#Let's consider one of the nodes (data3) and what it contains
Before node-data3 shutdown
data3
shard 3 replica
shard 4 primary
shard 0 primary

master
shard 3 primary

data1
shard 4 replica

data2
shard 0 replica

Test if nodes containing replicas will turn into primary or other nodes 
will be picked up for primary shard allocation
After node-data3 shutdown

data1
shard 4 replica--shows as primary
unassigned: shard 4 replica

data2
shard 0 replica--shows as primary
unassigned:shard 0 replica

in few seconds we see the replicas are assigned to other available nodes
data1:shard 4 (earlier replica): primary
data2:shard 4 (newly assigned): replica 

data2:shard 0(earlier replica): primary
master:shard 0(newly assigned): replica
